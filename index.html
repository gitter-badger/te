The Application Programming Interface (API) is a broad concept for accessing tools and data. In this course, our focus will be primarily on web-based data APIs, but we will begin by looking at APIs for software libraries and frameworks, particularly JavaScript and JavaScript projects such as jQuery and Node.js. Tremendous computing power and data access.

The course will be divided into two primary parts: API consumption and API production. Within the consumption part, we will look at programming APIs (e.g., for jQuery) and data APIs. The creation portion of the course will focus on the creation of data APIs in JSON.

* Locating APIs and their documentation, and learning to read API documentation
* Gaining access to restricted APIs and working with API keys and authentication
* Accessing and consuming API data
* Mashing up the data from one API with the data from another
