  Suppose you want to get a list of all of the cars towed in the city of Chicago yesterday. Suppose
  you want also to display that list on a Google Map, without having to manually enter data points?
  Or perhaps you wanted to pull down all of the comments on a particular story from the <i>New York
  Times</i> for computational analysis. Or maybe you're ready to build the next killer app for
  iPhone or the open Web, using openly available data from government or private sources.
</p>
<p>
  This class is for you.
</p>
<p>
  The Application Programming Interface (API) is a broad concept for making software tools and data
  accessible to do exactly those things. The focus of this course will be web-based data APIs, but
  we will begin by looking at APIs for software libraries and frameworks, particularly Ruby and
  JavaScript and JavaScript projects such as <a href="http://api.jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and
  <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/">Node.js</a> (we will use those to build projects
  for accessing and manipulating data APIs and, later, building our own APIs).
</p>
<p>
  The course will be divided into two parts: API consumption and API production. Within the
  consumption part, which will be about two-thirds of the course, we will look at programming APIs
  (e.g., for jQuery) and web-available data APIs. The creation portion that makes up the last third
  of the course will focus on the creation of data APIs in JSON, and building their documentation.
</p>
<h2>Some Course Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Locating open data APIs and gaining access to restricted APIs</li>
  <li>Working with API keys and authentication</li>
  <li>Learning effective strategies for navigating and reading API documentation</li>
  <li>Understanding common data API response and data serialization formats, especially JSON</li>
  <li>Mashing up the data from one API with the data from one or more additional APIs</li>
  <li>Building and documenting RESTful web APIs that others may use</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some Course Readings</h2>

  <li>David Copeland, <i>Building Awesome Command-Line Applications with Ruby</i></li>
  <li>Marijn Haverbeke, <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i></li>
</ul>
