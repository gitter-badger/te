  <h1>Application Programming Interfaces</h1>
  <p>
    A new course to be taught by <a href="http://karlstolley.com/">Karl Stolley</a> at
    <a href="http://www.iit.edu/">IIT</a> in Fall 2013.

  What do the Chicago Transit Authority, <i>The New York Times</i>, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook,
  and fans of the band Phish have in common? Each offers data APIs that provide some level of access
  to data generated and curated by the organization and its users. All of those services are in the
  company of <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=category">thousands of others</a>
  that provide access to data and services ranging categories from weather to music to shopping.
</p>
<p>
  If you're looking to learn how to access, archive, repackage, and/or create new mashups of open
  data, this class is for you, whether your purpose is to create a dataset for analysis or to build
  the next killer Web or mobile app. You'll learn how to understand and work within each data API's
  terms of service. And if you have or are looking to build a data set to share openly with the
  rest of the world through your own API, you'll learn how to do that, too.
</p>
<p>
  The Application Programming Interface (API) is a broad concept for making software tools and data
  accessible to do exactly those things. The focus of this course will be web-based data APIs, but
  we will begin by looking at APIs for software libraries and frameworks, particularly Ruby and
  JavaScript and JavaScript projects such as <a href="http://api.jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and
  <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/">Node.js</a> (we will use those to build projects
  for accessing and manipulating data APIs and, later, building our own APIs).
</p>
<p>
  The course will be divided into two parts: API consumption and API production. Within the
  consumption part, which will be about two-thirds of the course, we will look first at programming
  APIs (e.g., for jQuery) and then more extensively at web-available data APIs. The creation portion
  that makes up the last third of the course will focus on the creation of data APIs in JSON, and
  writing documentation to simplify access for others.
</p>
<h2>Some Course Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Locating open data APIs and gaining access to restricted APIs</li>
  <li>Working with API keys and authentication</li>
  <li>Learning effective strategies for navigating and reading API documentation</li>
  <li>Understanding common data API response and data serialization formats, especially JSON</li>
  <li>Mashing up the data from one API with the data from one or more additional APIs</li>
  <li>Building and documenting RESTful web APIs that others may use</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some Course Readings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>David Copeland, <i>Building Awesome Command-Line Applications with Ruby</i></li>
  <li>Marijn Haverbeke, <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i></li>
</ul>

    COM580: Application Programming Interfaces will meet Wednesday nights from 6:25 to 9:05
    beginning August 21, 2013. PhD students in Tech Comm and MS students in IARC and TCID can
    substitute this course for COM541: Information Structure and Retrieval. For more information,
